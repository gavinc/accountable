Never leave the command line to update a ticket again!

## Getting started

## Why?
Jira already supports robus triggers, like changing a ticket's status
based on a pull request, or branch created. However, there are times
when these automated triggers aren't enough.

Often, you'll start work
locally, and forget to put the ticket in progress. You
ever leave the command line to update a ticket again!
